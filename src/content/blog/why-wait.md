title: 'Why wait?'

Today I went to the DMV to get a NY state license because my out of state license had expired. I had originally planned to get there at 8:30 when they opened but I got a late start and was there around 9:15am. I ended up writing the post below while I waited because I couldn't focus on GRE math problems amidst the constant interruptions of the robotic voice alerting people to which windows were open. It was like being in a bureaucratic casino if that makes sense. The rest of the blog post are my actual observations just as I jotted them down in my notebook.**_First some general observations about the DMV:_**

*   no signage
*   no clarity on what line to stand in
*   no one up front greeting or telling you where to go including the security guards are not greeting/ guiding people in government offices (e.g. Marriage bureau, social security)
*   it seems like most of the transactions that are happening here could be done online aside from ensuring credentials (e.g. SS#, passport)
*   there is lady that is at the "number-getting" desk that has to yell out where people should go to make sure they aren't in the wrong line, seems to happen every 30 minutes
*   there are a lot of lines required to get something done; line 1 is to sort people out and assign them a number and line 2 is taking some kind of action and line 3, is where the transaction is hopefully complete.

In my case the process has gone like this:

*   9:15am: I ask someone where to go and they point me to the number-getting line
*   9:24am: I'm called to the desk from the number-getting line where I'm asked what I need to do, my form is reviewed for completeness and I'm given a number and told to wait on the other side
*   10:15am:

*   My number is finally up and I walk to a window (my first number sheet had calculated the estimated wait time was 28 mins, I had waited 50 minutes to get here)
*   The lady checked my application, took a picture, I signed a piece of paper and then she gave me a new number

*   10:58am:

*   My second number is announced on the board, I walk up to the counter with my paperwork
*   The lady there reviews my ID again, types in all of my information, processes my payment and then hands me a temporary license

*   11:09am: I leave the DMV.

When people think about the government I bet they think of the DMV, the marriage license bureau, jury duty, social security office. I've happened to have such a year where I had business in all of these offices. I've spent more time staring at wood benches and beige walls than anyone should in a 12 month period. What I've realized is that the waiting has become somewhat normal and as I look around, it seems like most people are resigned to being here for awhile. But why? Why do we think this is okay? Sure it's just a couple of hours but that means a lot to someone who had to take a day off to wait in line.All of my time in waiting rooms this year, rounded out by the DMV, was a helpful reminder that these kinds of inefficiencies could be alleviated or at least improved with better technology and access to information. What if we automated things, so more could be done online? What if we formed a partnership with the local library so that people who needed computer assistance could work with someone who understood the technology? What if we take a step back from the assembly line approach to bureaucratic offices and think about having people do multiple tasks under the "customer service" umbrella?**My Recommendations on How to Improve the Process** 1\. Put up signs so people know where to go and make considerations for people who might need language assistance. (From my observation today, that was a lot of people).

*   For example, maybe they could use the 3 or 4 flat screen TV's I observed that had highlights on the upcoming Kardashian pregnancy and the weight of the new Macbook air. Perhaps using that to flash directions/instructions in different languages?

2\. Develop a secure online form for people who have Internet access and are willing to take the time to complete their information before they arrive.

*   When people who have filled out their forms online and are prepared, allow them to enter an "expedited" line where all their information is available to the customer service representative

3\. Train people to do multiple functions so you can expedite the transaction( in this case getting a license) so that you can reduce the number of lines. Each person in line can be considered a "client" and each person behind the counter the customer service representative.

*   I'm speaking to this because in my experience a lot of the state and local offices are beholden to the old structure of having each person the master of a very specific domain. This caused all kinds of gridlock because often there would be one person responsible for an essential function and that person could only work so fast. Leaders need to rethink this strategy, especially as it applies to the operational aspects of an organization.

4\. Improve the actual website.

*   If anyone's been to the [DMV website](http://www.nydmv.state.ny.us/), you'll know it does not adhere to good design principles. Pages upon pages of text are not useful or used. There are also a ton of typos and circular loops of links. I know that it may be a step up in comparison to other states' websites but NY state can't lag behind. The state is large and services are in demand especially the offices in New York City and their website isn't doing them or any of the users any favors. Yes there are definitely services available online, but given that I was in their offices on a regular Wednesday before 10am and there seemed to be a few hundred people with no sign of stoppage, I'd say that the usage is low.
