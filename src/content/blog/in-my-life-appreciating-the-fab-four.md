As I was reminded by my brother yesterday, it was more than twenty years ago that we became Beatles fans. I think I was about 9 at the time when my dad came home with two CDs to play on our brand new CD player - Hard Day's Night and Please Please Me. Those two discs changed my world. Over the years, I became a devoted fan, as evidenced by the many postcards and posters that adorned my bedroom walls not to mention the growing collection of Beatles CDs including the anthology parts 1-3. Â The recent resurgence of Beatlemania reminded me how much the group inspired and uplifted me. They remain my favorite band. As I watched the tribute concert last night that commemorated 50 years since the Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show, it made me happy to see the multigenerational appeal that they still had. The tribute was also an illustration of how music can and does bring people together across all walks of life.
