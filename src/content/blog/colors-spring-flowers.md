I've been inspired lately by the existence of color in nature. This series of photos, some taken on a recent trip through London and Paris and others on a visit to the nearby Brooklyn Botanical Garden, has been inspired by the beautiful color provided by springtime blooms.**Pink magnolias in the evening light**

This project would not have started if I hadn't had access to such a user friendly camera. (This set of pictures was taken on my iPhone 8mp camera). After I got my new phone last fall, I kept taking pictures and found that I really enjoyed it again. In the process of flipping pics of everything from my dinners to interesting PSAs to family/friends, I realized how drawn I was to color. This particular set focuses on images in nature, but I have a whole other set of pictures that is front doors painted in unique colors. I realized that once I started looking at the world in potential photographable moments/objects, more and more things jumped out at me.While I will continue to take photos with my iPhone, this project has actually inspired me to learn how to work a more complicated camera and learn more about aperture, light, shadows, etc.
