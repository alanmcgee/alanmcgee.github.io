One of the things about a dissertation is that you are so focused on writing and finishing that at times the joy of writing begins to flicker and fade. At least, that was the case for me. I couldn't have imagined writing more when I was writing my dissertation, writing for publications, and writing job applications. However, I am excited about the idea of starting to write and think about education again. I have so much on my mind that I want to work out and blogging seems like the right way to do it. At least as a start.
