I like so many millions around the world felt tears rush to my eyes when I saw the words in print- Nelson Mandela, dead at 95. I was struck by the outpouring of grief across media. Every site I turned to had a different picture of Madiba, an iconic figure who did in fact change our world. As the President reported yesterday, we will likely not see someone like him again. The evidence of Nelson Mandela's imprint on the world was visible across the web yesterday just after 5:30pm (EST): each site posting several different pictures and articles about him. As I looked across them, I thought that even in death, he managed to bring the world a little closer together - with so many of us confronting his likeness as we went about our everyday. I am left overwhelmed and inspired by his legacy. I have no idea what the future holds but I do hope that his memory and his sacrifice persist.
