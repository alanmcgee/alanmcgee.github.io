Last night, I caught a few minutes of the evening news, listening to to the commentary about the shootings in Newton, Connecticut. My ears piqued and I decided to see if this was true. I came across [an article](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57559325/will-connecticut-school-shooting-spur-gun-control-action/) that confirmed that Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, was one of the senators that voted against a ban on high ammunition clips and also in favor of an amendment to allow people to conceal weapons while crossing state borders. Here's an excerpt from that CBS article:

_"In 2009, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was among 58 senators to back an amendment allowing a person holding a concealed weapon permit in one state to hide his firearm when visiting another state._

_After Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and others were attacked in Tucson in January 2011, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was killed in a 1993 shooting, introduced legislation to ban the high-capacity ammunition clips used by the shooter. (Those clips would have been banned had the assault weapons ban been reinstated.) The measure garnered more than 100 cosponsors but was not brought up for consideration by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Indeed, the only movement in recent years on guns has been in the opposite direction: They include measures that_ [_allow guns in bars in Virginia and New Mexico_](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20028226-503544.html)_,_ [_expanded concealed carry in Michigan_](http://www.freep.com/article/20121214/NEWS15/312140129/State-House-Senate-pass-bill-allowing-guns-carried-more-places) _and elsewhere, and a Supreme Court decision_ [_striking down a ban on handguns and a trigger lock requirement in the District of Columbia_](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/28/supremecourt/main6626538.shtml)_." (Brian Montpoli, CBS News, 12/14/12)_

The article goes onto point out that Democrats who have favored control in the past have done nothing to bring back the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 or advocate for other legislation. I said it yesterday and I will say it again, how many shootings will it take before people understand that having guns that were developed for war should not be allowed to be owned by civilians? Another excellent point that I think needs to be raised is that any new gun control legislation needs to also address the very important issue of mental illness.In any case, here is my letter to Harry Reid that I submitted on his website today:

_Dear Senator Reid,_

_I recently heard on the news that you would be against introducing legislation into the Senate along the lines of controlling the use and proliferation of guns. I find this an unfortunate stance from the top Democrat in the Senate._

_Protecting second amendment rights is logical to a certain point, but there are dangerous weapons that are too easily accessed that no American needs to protect their home or property._

_Every person I know, regardless of political affiliation has spoken out about gun violence and the need for change over the last 36 hours. People are horrified by what happened and no American parent should have to get up every morning praying that this doesn't happen at their school._

_I've already written to my congressman and signed a petition online but I do think that if you're the person who will influence the potential for such legislation, then we need to somehow convince you that it's ridiculous you are in favor of concealing weapons. You might be a Senator from Nevada, but as far as I'm concerned as the majority leader of the Senate you are representing all of our interests. So when you vote against or squelch legislation that is more than necessary, it is disheartening. This shouldn't be about votes - this should be about your commitment to the American people- all of us._

_Please turn your stance around, show leadership and bring a bill that not only addresses gun control and proliferation but measures to also deal with mental illness and the related supports required so we can avoid these kinds of mass atrocities._

_I sincerely hope you show leadership on this issue._

_Best,_

_Veena Vasudevan_
